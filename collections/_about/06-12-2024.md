introduction: "I am Rohan R. Arora, a Senior Software Engineer at <a href=\"https://research.ibm.com/\">IBM Research</a>. 
I joined IBM Research in 2016 after graduating from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign with a Master's Degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering.
In my early career at IBM, I co-led the effort on developing augmented-reality and virtual-reality-based solutions for the enterprise.
Since 2021, I have been working at the intersection of machine learning (ML) and IT operations, particularly in the areas of incident management and resource optimization."
