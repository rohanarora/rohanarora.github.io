organization: "IBM Thomas J. Watson Research Center, Yorktown Heights, New York, USA"
role1_contributions: "<ul>
                          <li>Co-leading ITBench, an open-source benchmarking framework for evaluating AI Agents across diverse real-world IT Automation tasks—from initial design to development and now to community building. Spotlight paper at ICML 2025.</li>
                          <li>Enabled a team of 5 researchers to develop an approach to optimize GPU usage for large language model (LLM) inferencing tasks.</li>
                          <li>Co-led a team of 5 researchers to develop an explainable unsupervised machine learning (ML) method to help site reliability engineers (SREs) identify idle workloads in their IT environments.
                              This has resulted in reduction of IT resources by 25% in a few large IT environments.</li>
                      </ul>"
role2_contributions: "<ul>
                          <li>Co-designed and developed a methodology to filter noisy irrelevant anomalies.
                              This addressed the issue of false alarms that result in SRE alert fatigue.</li>
                          <li>Built sandbox environments to seamlessly deploy and evaluate existing AIOps product assets.
                              This has reduced (and continues to reduce) the time for integration of new research capabilities into the products.</li>
                      </ul>"
role3_contributions: "<ul>
                          <li>Co-led the effort to define, design, and develop a cloud-native remote assistance solution based on augmented reality (AR) for IBM’s
            Technology Lifecycle Services (TLS) division. The effort led to the transformation of IBM's TLS division and won 2 accomplishment awards at IBM. </li>
                          <li>Interacted with end-users, defined the product roadmap, and facilitated sprint planning meetings.</li>
                          <li>Contributions as a developer were to code a Django REST Framework-based backend, an Angular-based frontend, and a minimalistic Android application.</li>
                      </ul>"
